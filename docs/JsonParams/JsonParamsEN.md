         ```Gherkin
         And I wait the field named "FieldName" will be filled in 10 seconds
         ```
         then in reality the maximum step time will be 20 seconds, not 10.

      * **pauseonwindowopening**:
         Additional pause value that will always be applied in a step
         ```Gherkin
         Then "WindowTitle" window is opened
         And I wait "WindowTitle" window opening in 60 seconds
         And I wait the window with header different from "WindowTitle" opening in 60 seconds
         ```

      * **safeexecutionofsteps**:
         Adds delay for multiple actions, which may cause unstable scenario execution, e.g.: move to line, field value check etc.
         This option slow the execution down .

*  Updating data in a tree in steps

      * **updatetreewhenscenariostarts**:
         If the checkbox is on, current row of the tree will be active on step execution. It is recomended to turn the checkbox off on CI server to fasten up.

      * **distinguishbrokenorfailedbythenkeyword**:
         If the checkbox is on, assembly status will be set to Failed only if failing step starts with Then keyword. In all other cases - Broken. This helps distinguish broken tests from real configuration errors.

*  Other script execution settings

      * **dosleepusingping**:
         If this option is enabled, then the Sleep() method will be called through a call to the Ping command. This is necessary if the testing client window is currently not responding to requests.

      * **banoverwritingvariables**:
         If the checkbox is on, pending steps will set assembly status to failed on the execution on CI server.
         It is recommended to set this checkbox on.
