         If the checkbox is on, data for translation into another language will be added when clicking the scenario step by step.

      * **searchformelementsbyname**:
         If the flag is set, then when generating the script text after pasting, the steps in the script will search for form elements by their internal name.
         If the flag is unchecked, then when generating the script text after being pasted, the steps in the script will search for form elements by title, if possible.
         This is possible if there is only one element with the given heading in the given form.

      * **ShowWindowToStopRecordingUserActions**:
         Enables the display of an additional window for conveniently stopping the recording of user actions and switching to the Vanessa Automation window. You must enable the use of the VanessaExt component.

      * **UseTemplateForNewFeature**:
         If a template is specified (in *.txt format), then a new script will be created from it

      * **instrpath**:
         The catalog of Vanessa Automation data processor. This field must be filled on the standard installation.
         When working with Vanessa Automation Single it is allowed to leave the field blank.

      * **TemporaryFilesDirectory**:
         The directory in which temporary script files will be created.
         If a setting value is specified, then temporary script files will be created in it. If the setting value is not specified, then the user's temporary directory will be used. Usually this
         "C:\USERS%username%\APPDATA\LOCAL\TEMP".
         Setting is necessary because... Vanessa Automation can create bat files to run system commands, and some operating systems may prohibit running such files from the user's temporary directory.

      * **SmokeTestsCleanDirectoryOutputFiles**:
         If set, feature files in the output files directory will be deleted before tests are generated.

      * **SmokeTestsOnlyEnteredObjects**:
         When this flag is enabled, only objects for which there is at least one element not marked for deletion in the current infobase will participate in the generation of feature files of extended actions.

      * **SmokeTestsOnlyChangedRelativeToVendorConfiguration**:
         When this flag is enabled, only objects changed relative to the provider configuration will participate in the generation of feature files. To build a report on comparing configurations, the current infobase configurator will be launched with the current user and an empty password.

      * **SmokeTestsVendorConfigurationName**:
         The name of the vendor configuration to compare configurations with.

*  System settings

      * **thetreetagisenabledbydefault**:
         If the checkbox is on, feature file is considered as if it has @tree tag, even if it is absent. In other words, any uploaded feature file is considered as hierarchical.

      * **EvaluateExpressionsInCurlyBraces**:
         Turns on the mode when any expression inside the parameters of the steps {} will be evaluated. If the section "Variables" is declared, but first an attempt will be made to find a variable from this section by the specified expression. Otherwise, an attempt will be made to evaluate the expression in {}.
         If {expression} is used, then the expression will be evaluated on the client.
         If {!expression} Is used, the expression will be evaluated on the server.

         The file path or url where the settings are located. By default, the project directory (default filename is user_settings.json) or localhost.
         As a result of reading the settings file, global variables will be created.
         When running tests from the command line, to create variables, you need to pass them in the main settings json file in the "GlobalVars" parameter, which is an array of Key:Value values.

      * **commandtoopenfeatureintexteditor**:
         This field contains a text editor to open a feature file and position on the current line when clicking "Open .feature file in editor".

## Test client settings

*  Test client launch

      * **runtestclientwithmaximizedwindow**:
         If the option is on, TestClient will launch in full-screen mode.

      * **modalwindowwhenstartingtestclientiserror**:
         If this option is enabled, then the modal window when starting the test client means a test client connection error.

      * **starttestclientsessionagainonconnectionifitsprocessisnotfound**:
         Enables restarting the test client process if the previous run did not work (for example, if no license was obtained). For thick and thin clien only.

      * **DetermineTheRealPortOnWhichTheTestingClientWasLaunched**:
         If this option is enabled, then when the testing client connects, an attempt will be made to determine the real port on which the testing client was launched.
         It is necessary. since the testing client can change the port on which it started, despite the passed parameters.
         This issue is relevant when running tests on Linux.

      * **testclientprocessstartinterval**:
         Specifies the interval at which an attempt will be made to start a testing client session.

      * **testclienttimeout**:

         The file name will be generated according to the rule TestingClientName+LaunchDateTime.

      * **DisableScheduledJobsExecutionForFileInfobase**:
         If this option is enabled, scheduled jobs execution will be disabled when new test client will start for a file infobase. Uses command line key /AllowExecuteScheduledJobs -Off

      * **OnlyOneTestClientAllowedToRun**:
         If this option is enabled, control will be enabled that more than one testing client cannot be connected at the same time.
         This can be useful if the computers on which the tests are run have a limited amount of RAM and you need to control the launch of unnecessary processes.

      * **CheckingServerCallsInEventHandlers**:
         Adds the string /EnableCheckServerCalls to the launch options of test clients.
         When the test completes, it checks the "Technical Support Information" window for special messages about context server calls.
         If such messages were found, a script error will be raised.
         Detailed information here

*  TestClient debug

      * **testclientdebug**:

      * **usebrowserwebsocket**:
         Allows to execute external commands in the browser using WebSocket.
         For the option to work, you must enable the use of the VanessaExt component.

*  Closing test client

      * **forceclosetestclient**:
         If the flag is set, then when closing the testing client, it will be checked whether the testing client has closed by its PID. If the testing client has not closed normally, an attempt will be made to close it using the OS command.

      * **timeoutbeforeforciblyclosingtestclient**:
         The number of seconds to check that the testing client process completed on its own.

*  Mobile client

      * **PathToadb**:

## Running scenarios

*  Logging and notification

      * **logtogr**:
         If the checkbox is on, scenario and steps beginning events will be written to the event log.

      * **soundnotificationwhenscriptends**:
         If this option is enabled, the following sound notification will be issued at the end of the script execution:
                 1. Scripts completed successfully.
                 2. An error occurred while executing the script.
                 3. The breakpoint was triggered.
         You must enable the use of the VanessaExt addin.
         This option only works under Windows.

*  Script execution speed

      * **makestepsasync**:
         If the checkbox is on, each step will be executed asynchronously with the specified delay.
         If the checkbox is off, the steps will be executed synchronously. Steps tree will be updated on each 100th step.
         Scenario runs several times faster when the flag is off.

      * **SpacingStepSpecifiedUser**:
         Specifies delay between steps in asynchronous mode.

*  When an error occurs

      * **stoponerror**:
         If the checkbox is on, scenario will be executed until the first error occurs.
         All the following scenarios will be skipped.

      * **showrownumberonerror**:
         If flag is set, when an error occurs in tree steps will be shown column with the row number in the tree, if this column was hidden.
         Actual when working in the step tree mode.

*  Stop script execution

      * **ShowWindowForStoppingScriptExecution**:
         Enables the display of an additional window that allows you to stop the execution of the script. You need to enable the use of the VanessaExt component.

      * **UseAFileToStopScriptExecution**:
         If this option is enabled, then when you click the stop script execution button in a special window, a temporary file will be created, and Vanessa Automation will stop the script execution by checking for the presence of this file.

*  Update of script execution statistics

      * **updatestatistics**:
         If the flag is set, then statistics are updated during script execution: how many script steps have passed, how many scripts have crashed, and so on.

*  Test execution stabilization

      * **NumberOfAttemptsToExecuteTheScript**:
         If the setting specifies a value of more than one, then if the script was not executed successfully, several more attempts to execute the script will be made.

      * **DisableForFieldsAbilityToOverwriteTextWhenServerCall**:
         There is a problem that when synchronizing the state of the form after the server call has completed, the text that the user is currently editing may be overwritten.
         In tests, this can manifest itself in such a way that the test entered a value into a field, but before it began working with another field, this value was returned to its previous state.
         This option enables a mechanism where the "EditTextUpdate" property of form fields will change after calling the step
         ```Gherkin
         Then "WindowTitle" window is opened
         ```
         For this option to work, the VAExtension extension must be installed in the testing client database.

      * **numberofattemptstoperformanaction**:
         Sets maximum tries number for multiple steps.
         Increasing this parameter may make scenarios execution more stable on the weak hardware.

      * **timetofindwindow**:
         Maximum time to search for a window in a step
         ```Gherkin
         Then "WindowTitle" window is opened
         ```

      * **timeoutforasynchronoussteps**:
         Specifies the maximum time to wait for an asynchronous step.
         For example, if the parameter value is set to 20 seconds and the step is used
         ```Gherkin
         And I wait the field named "FieldName" will be filled in 10 seconds
         ```
         then in reality the maximum step time will be 20 seconds, not 10.

      * **pauseonwindowopening**:
         Additional pause value that will always be applied in a step
         ```Gherkin
         Then "WindowTitle" window is opened
         And I wait "WindowTitle" window opening in 60 seconds
         And I wait the window with header different from "WindowTitle" opening in 60 seconds
         ```

      * **MaximumExecutionTimeAction**:
         Sets the maximum execution time for actions that return a value to the test manager.
         If the specified time is exceeded, the exception "The maximum execution time of the action on the testing client side has been exceeded" is generated. In this case, the action will continue.
         If the parameter is 0, commands wait until the end of execution without checking the elapsed time since the start of execution.

      * **safeexecutionofsteps**:
         Adds delay for multiple actions, which may cause unstable scenario execution, e.g.: move to line, field value check etc.
         This option slow the execution down .

*  Updating data in a tree in steps

      * **updatetreewhenscenariostarts**:
         If the checkbox is on, current row of the tree will be active on step execution. It is recomended to turn the checkbox off on CI server to fasten up.
         Actual when working in the step tree mode.

*  Script statuses

      * **pendingequalfailed**:
         If the checkbox is on, pending steps will set assembly status to failed on the execution on CI server.
         It is recommended to set this checkbox on.

      * **distinguishbrokenorfailedbythenkeyword**:
         If the checkbox is on, assembly status will be set to Failed only if failing step starts with Then keyword. In all other cases - Broken. This helps distinguish broken tests from real configuration errors.

*  Other script execution settings

      * **dosleepusingping**:
         If this option is enabled, then the Sleep() method will be called through a call to the Ping command. This is necessary if the testing client window is currently not responding to requests.

      * **banoverwritingvariables**:
         If the checkbox is on, pending steps will set assembly status to failed on the execution on CI server.
         It is recommended to set this checkbox on.

      * **updateformtableswhengettingvalue**:
         If this option is enabled, then when receiving a table, the test will try to find and click on the "Refresh" table button and press it.
         An update attempt will occur if there are several attempts to get the table value and the first attempt was unsuccessful.

      * **getlayoutsusingextensionvaextension**:
         Enables retrieval of layout values (printable forms and reports) using the VAExtension.
         Allows you to receive the entire layout with the design in the web client.

## Screenshots

   * **onerrorscreenshot**:
      Enables taking screenshots in case of an error or on demand (the @screenshot tag is specified before the step).
      To enable the option, make sure the "Screenshot creation command" field is filled in or VanessaExt is enabled.

   * **onerrorscreenshoteverywindow**:
      Enables taking screenshots for each 1C window when an error occurs.
      SikuliX or VanessaExt (recommended) is used for this option.

   * **useaddinforscreencapture**:
      To take screenshots, use the VanessaExt add-in instead of the screenshot creation command.
      For the option to work, it is necessary to enable the use of the VanessaExt external component.

   * **TakeBrowserScreenshots**:
      If this option is enabled, then if an error occurs when the browser is connected via the debug port, an attempt will be made to take a screenshot of the browser.

   * **outputscreenshot**:
      Screenshots directory.

   * **screencaptureaddinmethod**:
      Full Screen - Gets a screenshot of the entire screen, including the operating system taskbar.

         SikuliX is a Java application that allows you to control mouse movements and clicks on the screen, as well as emulate keystrokes on the keyboard.
         SikuliX Server is a special software optimization for working with SikuliX. If the option is enabled, VA builds one large script from many SikuliX scripts, which can be run once and quickly execute the necessary commands that previously had to be run one at a time. This allows you to significantly save time for executing one SikuliX script, because no time wasted on launching SikuliX and unloading it from memory.
         Installation and configuration of SikuliX and SikuliX Server is described in help section 20.1
